<p>
Machine Learning Algorithms implemented in Python to improve IIT Mandi's Disaster Management Readiness and Plans using Landslide Data from 10 IoT sensors placed across the campus. 
Another optimization is for the Mandi district itself to find relations and inferences from electricity consumption data to increase efficiency and reduce wastage.
Some Unsupervised Clustering Algorithms such as DBSCAN and Agglomerative clustering.
